_Raqq_ (رَقّ) is a manuscript Kufic typeface, that intends to replicate (as
faithfully as possible) the third century AH (early Abbasid) style of Kufic
script used in writing the Quran. _Raqq_ is Arabic for parchment.

_Raqq_ uses color font technology to replicate the colored vocalization system
of red, yellow and green dots used in these early Quranic manuscripts.

_Raqq_ is intended more for use in smaller font sizes (possibly inline in
scholarly texts) as it has large to body letter forms and a sturdy feel.

_Raqq_ design is based mostly on the Cambridge University Library manuscript [MS Add.1116].
