Raqq (رَقّ) is a manuscript Kufic typeface, that intends to replicate (as
faithfully as possible) the third century AH (early Abbasid) style of Kufic
script used in writing the Quran. Raqq is Arabic for parchment.

Raqq uses color font technology to replicate the colored vocalization system of
red, yellow and green dots used in these early Quranic manuscripts.

Raqq design is based mostly on the Cambridge University Library manuscript MS
Add.1116.

Raqq is a free and open source project, any one is welcomed to use and modify
it under the terms of the version 3 of GNU Affero General Public License. See
