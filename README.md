Raqq
====

*Raqq* (رَقّ) is a manuscript *Kufic* typeface, that intends to replicate (as
faithfully as possible) the third century AH style of *Kufic* used in writing
the *Quran*.

*Raqq* uses color font technology to replicate the old vocalization system of
red, yellow and green dots used in these *Quranic* manuscripts.

*Raqq* comes in two styles, a **text** and **display** style. The text style is
intended more for use in smaller font sizes (possibly inline in scholarly
texts) and has larger letter forms and more sturdy feel, while the display
style is intended for larger sizes and more artistic work and has more delicate
and refined feel.

The text style is based mostly on [MS Add.1116][1], while the display is based
on [ARABE 350][2].

The text style is more finished, while the display style is still mostly a work
in progress.
